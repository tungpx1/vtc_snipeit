# Primary CI checks for Rollbar-PHP-Laravel.
# We're checking that logging within Laravel passes through the Rollbar Laravel
# integration when that integration is properly installed. We make this check
# for all supported combinations of Laravel, Rollbar, and PHP. We are not
# checking that messages are properly sent to Rollbar: that's handled by
# rollbar-php.
#
# Test with act:
#   brew install act
#   act -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest
#
# @see https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/329
